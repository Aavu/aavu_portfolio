                <p>This is my graduate research assistant project for the Fall 2018. I am working under Prof.Gil Weinberg at the Georgia Tech Center for Music Technology.</p>
                <p>I am currently working on the extension of a previous work.</p>
                <p>This demonstration uses support vector machines to classify finger movements.</p>
                <p>I am working on a Convolutional Neural Network based regression model to respond to finger by finger movements. The goal is to minimize latency and maximize correlation.</p>
