                Concept ~<br />
                Motherhood is undoubtedly the most prestigious relationship . We wanted to showcase a conversation between Yashoda and Krishna - a small scenario that all mothers can relate to.<br />

                "It is dusk, and the sun has started to set. Yashoda is searching for baby Krishna, but he is nowhere to be found. She then hears a small chuckling noise under a few bushes in the garden, she runs and finds Krishna covered in mud. She bathes him and plays with him. She then realizes it has become dark, and time for her son to sleep. For whom she sings a lullaby (Thaalaatu) and puts to sleep."<br />

                We felt this song in particular gelled really well with the theme. It also holds a very special place in my heart (one of my most favorite songs).<br />

                It was a great experience working with artists of high caliber like Raghavasimhan Sankaranaryanan, we enjoyed every part of this project.<br />

                Special thanks to Sri. Ganapathi for playing the Tabla for us.<br />

            <p>One of the evergreen classics of AR Rahman!</p>
            <p>The lead and vocal harmonies are performed using a Talkbox triggered using an Electric Violin! During a Talkbox performance, the lyrics are never sung but just mouthed i.e. The vocal cord is not used. The sound/tone that is heard is from the electric violin. </p>
            <p>Viol Kazoo is a modification of Kazoo that enables the use of violin to play it. The output of the Talkbox is routed to the input of the Kazoo. The tube of the Talkbox has to be carefully inserted into the mouthpiece of the Kazoo to achieve the right tone.</p>

                This piece as the name suggests melts the listener's mood with its beautiful structure and scintillating Raga - The Charukesi.

The women take a ride on a beautiful boat (‘nauka’) on the Yamuna river. During the journey, they make fun of Krishna. Krishna creates a thunderous rain that threatens to sink the boat. The women, however, forsake their clothes to cover the holes in the boat and pray to the Gods to help the little Krishna. He feels sorry and puts everything back to normal.</p>
